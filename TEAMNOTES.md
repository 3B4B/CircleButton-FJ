 ## Jimmy Kane 09/21 Lessons Learned from Class
 I learned that we have approached this project the wrong way, mostly because I didn't read the directions closely.  I thought that since we were making a button we were not allowed to use the button tag.  Also this project is much more manageable now than I though it was after watching Bryan go through what he expects.  I also learned there are CSS stylers online to the work of styling for us, which I will be messing with after class today.

 From here there are a lot of changes to come.
 -[* ] Update HTML in Render function to include slot and button tag
 -[ *] Go to a button styler website, style a circle button we link, and add it to styles()
 -[ ] Create a different style for when high constrast, dark mode, or normal is applied to tag
 -[ ] Styling and functional disabeled state
